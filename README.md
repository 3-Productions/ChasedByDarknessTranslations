Avoid automatic translators (like Google Translate) as much as possible.

If necessary, you are free to consult a dictionary.




# How to translate:




			"Source":
			"Text": "English text"				<------------ Source text

			"Translation"
			"Text": "Text in another language"		<------------ Translated text


			Instructions: Only the SOURCE TEXT must be translated to TRANSLATION TEXT.
			





			In this example, the text in English was translated to Brazilian Portuguese:


			"Source":
			{
				"Text": "After the prison was evacuated, you were called in to deal with the situation."
			},
			"Translation":
			{
				"Text": "Depois que a prisão foi evacuada, você foi chamado para lidar com a situação."
			},
			"Key": "75CE705A4CCECB67E1BA32BE8DA1E1A8"
